# Vue 3 Masterclass — Real-World Practice Project (TypeScript + Composition API)

This repository contains my implementation of the Vue.js Masterclass, focused on mastering real-world Vue 3 development with the Composition API and clean component architecture.
It is a work in progress, updated as I complete more chapters, and demonstrates how I structure, organize, and build modern Vue applications.

##🔧 What This Project Demonstrates
Core Vue Skills
- Vue 3 Composition API
- Reusable components & props patterns
- TypeScript throughout the app
- Composables for clean logic separation
- Emitting updates between components
- Slots, transitions, and reactivity patterns
- App Architecture
- Folder structuring used in production Vue apps
- Centralized state with Pinia
- Vue Router with dynamic routes
- Layout system & UI patterns
- API helpers and data management logic
- Code Quality
- Strong TypeScript type safety
- Clean, maintainable structure
- Realistic component communication patterns
- Progressive enhancement as new features are learned

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repo

The goal of this project is to showcase my understanding of modern Vue 3 using real architectural patterns.
Instead of quick tutorials, this repo demonstrates how I apply Vue in a structured, scalable way—similar to a real production codebase.

This project also serves as a foundation for more advanced work in Nuxt, full-stack apps, and TypeScript-heavy Vue systems.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Vue 3
- TypeScript
- Pinia
- Vue Router
- Vite
- CSS (Tailwind optional depending on section)

## 🚧 Status: Work in Progress

This repository is actively being updated as I continue the Masterclass.
New chapters → new commits → new features and architectural improvements.
